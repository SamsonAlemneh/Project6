# Welcome to the ViroTour Documentation Repo!

ViroTour is a virtual tour software that specializes in displaying 3D captured images in an interative web/mobile application.  ViroTour uses these 3D images to create immersive tours that connect images in a virtual space, allowing users to move about the images in a natural and exciting way.  


## Build Instructions
1. Pull the documentation repo
2. Install Material for MkDocs - `pip install mkdocs-material`
3. Install glightbox MkDocs plugin - `pip install mkdocs-glightbox`
4. Ensure you are inside the `virotour-docs` directory (the server needs to see the `mkdocs.yml` file to function properly)
5. Start live preview local server - `mkdocs serve`
6. Edit away!  Saving your edits should automatically rebuild the documentation.
7. Build the static HTML files - `mkdocs build`
